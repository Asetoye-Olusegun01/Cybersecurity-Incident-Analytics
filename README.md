# Cybersecurity Incident Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive Cybersecurity Incident Analytics dashboard built with Power BI. The dashboard helps organizations monitor, analyze, and respond to security incidents efficiently. It highlights patterns in incident type, severity, department exposure, and response performance.

## Key Insights
- Malware and phishing incidents occur most frequently across departments.
- Severity distribution shows that a large percentage of cases are low to medium risk.
- Incident resolution time varies widely, indicating improvement opportunities.
- Certain departments report significantly higher incident counts.
- Resolved vs. unresolved incident ratios help assess security response capacity.

## Objectives of the Dashboard
- Track total incidents over time.
- Analyze incidents by type, department, and severity.
- Measure average resolution time and identify delays.
- Evaluate open vs. closed incidents.
- Support cybersecurity teams with real-time incident intelligence.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Incident ID  
- Date Reported  
- Department  
- Incident Type  
- Severity Level  
- Resolution Time (hours)  
- Status (Resolved/Unresolved)

The dataset was cleaned and transformed with Power Query, and additional KPIs were created using DAX.

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query Editor  
- DAX  
- Microsoft Excel

## About the Project
